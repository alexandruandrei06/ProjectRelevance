# Objective

This project aims to create an interactive console application for the following use case: We have a backpack into which multiple items of various types can be added. The backpack has three limitations: the total number of items it can accommodate, the weight it can carry, and the volume it can support.

Each item has two properties, weight and volume, and the backpack cannot be overloaded by adding too many items or exceeding the weight or volume limits.

Item list:

-   Sageata: greutate - 0.1; volum - 0.05
-   Arc: greutate - 1; volum - 4
-   Franghie: greutate - 1; volum - 1.5
-   Apa: greutate - 2; volum - 3
-   Portie de mancare: greutate - 1; volum 0.5
-   Sabie: greutate - 5; volum - 3
